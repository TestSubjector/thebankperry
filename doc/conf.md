# Conf

File name: /conf.js

## Introduction

This file defines the configuration variables necessary for the project to run. For obvious purposes this file is not a part of the repository.

## Requires

Nothing. This is a standalone module.

## Logic

Nothing logical, just a bunch of configuration variables. See for yourself:

```
var conf = {
    'telegramToken' : "insert-token-here",
    'dbname' : "thebankperry",
    'dbpath' : "mongodb://localhost/",
    'witToken': "insert-token-here",
    'mapsToken' : "insert-token-here"
};
module.exports = conf;
```

## Comments

The code is obvious. Wrote the documentation for practice.
